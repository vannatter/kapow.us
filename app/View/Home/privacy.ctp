	<h3>Regarding Children's Use of Site</h3>
	Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to use Kapow and we do not intentionally collect or maintain Personal Information from those who are under 13 years old.

	<b>Personal Information That You Provide</b><br/>
	In general, we collect Personal Information that you submit to us voluntarily through Kapow. We also collect information that you submit in the process of creating or editing your account and user profile on Kapow. For example, our registration and login process requires you to provide us with your name, valid email address and password of your choice. When you personalize your profile and use the features of Kapow, we will collect any information you voluntarily provide, and we may also request optional information to support your use of Kapow, such as your year of birth, gender and other demographic information. We collect information in the form of the content that you submit during your use of Kapow, such as photos, reviews, ratings and other information you choose to submit. We may also collect information about you and your friends who use Kapow, from any social network you may have connected from, in order to provide you with a more personalized experience. For instance, we may collect your user ID or profile information that you have permitted to be displayed through Kapow in order to display you as a friend or in association with your profile and collections. When you sign up for, or win, any contests, sweepstakes, or other activities that we make available on Kapow, we will collect the information designated along with such activity, which may include your contact information such as your address and phone number. If you choose to sign up to receive information about products or services that may be of interest to you, we will collect your email address and other related information. Additionally, we collect any information that you voluntarily enter, including Personal Information, into any postings, comments, or forums within the Kapow community.
	<br/><br/>

	We may receive Personal Information about you from other sources with which you have registered, companies who we have partnered with (collectively, "Partners") or other third parties. We may associate this information with the other Personal Information we have collected about you.
	<br/><br/>
	
	<b>E-Mail and E-Mail Addresses</b><br/>
	If you send an e-mail to us, or fill out our "Feedback" form through Kapow, we will collect your e-mail address and the full content of your e-mail, including attached files, and other information you provide.

You may indicate your preference to stop receiving further promotional communications as further detailed below.
	<br/><br/>
	
	<b>Information Collected Via Technology</b><br/>
	As you use Kapow, certain information may also be passively collected and stored on our or our service providers' server logs, including your Internet protocol address, browser type, and operating system. We also use Cookies and navigational data like Uniform Resource Locators (URL) to gather information regarding the date and time of your visit and the solutions and information for which you searched and viewed, or on which of the advertisements displayed on Kapow you clicked. This type of information is collected to make Kapow and solutions more useful to you and to tailor the experience with Kapow to meet your special interests and needs.
	<br/><br/>
	We engage in remarketing to market our sites across the web. When a user visits our site, a cookie is dropped on the user. Users with this cookie may be targeted across advertising networks to receive relevant advertisements. You may opt out of this ad serving using the Network Advertising Initiative (NAI) opt-out page (http://www.networkadvertising.org/managing/opt_out.asp).
	<br/><br/>
	An "Internet protocol address" or "IP Address" is a number that is automatically assigned to your computer when you use the Internet. In some cases your IP Address stays the same from browser session to browser session; but if you use a consumer internet access provider, your IP Address probably varies from session to session. For example, we, or our service providers, may track your IP Address when you access Kapow to assist with ad targeting.
	<br/><br/>
	"Cookies" are small pieces of information that a website sends to your computer's hard drive while you are viewing a website. We may use both session Cookies (which expire once you close your web browser) and persistent Cookies (which stay on your computer until you delete them) to provide you with a more personal and interactive experience with Kapow. Persistent Cookies can be removed by following your Internet browser help file directions. In order to use our services offered through Kapow, your web browser must accept Cookies. If you choose to disable Cookies, some aspects of Kapow may not work properly, and you may not be able to receive our services.
	<br/><br/>
	We may also enable advertisers and ad servers to promote third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on Kapow. These advertisers and ad servers may use Cookies and/or "Web Beacons" (which are usually small, transparent graphic images) in order to monitor information related to served advertisements. Clicking on such advertisements will direct you to the website of a third-party and the advertiser. This Privacy Policy does not cover the privacy practices of any advertisers or ad servers.
	<br/><br/>
	
	<h3>Use and Disclosure of Information</h3>
	Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise share for marketing purposes the Personal Information that we collect with third parties, unless you ask or authorize us to do so.
	<br/><br/>
	In general, Personal Information you submit to us is used by us to provide you access to Kapow, to improve Kapow, to better tailor the features, performance, and support of Kapow and to offer you additional information, opportunities, promotions and functionality from us, our partners or our advertisers at your request. Additionally, we do share your content preferences and other information with the social network with which you have connected to Kapow, along with those companies and persons you have asked us to share your information with.
	<br/><br/>
	We may provide your Personal Information to third-party service providers who work on behalf of or with us to provide some of the services and features of Kapow and to help us communicate with you. Examples of such services include sending email, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing payments (including credit card payments), and providing customer service. 
	<br/><br/>
	Additionally, we may create Anonymous Information records from Personal Information by excluding information (such as your name) that would otherwise make the Anonymous Information personally identifiable to you. Generally, we aggregate this information and use it in statistical analysis to help us analyze patterns in the use of Kapow. This Privacy Policy does not limit our use or disclosure of any Anonymous Information in any way, and we reserve the right to use and disclose Anonymous Information to our partners, advertisers and other third parties in our discretion.
	<br/><br/>
	In the event we go through a business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any acquirer of ours or that acquirer's assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
	<br/><br/>
	We may disclose your Personal Information if we believe in good faith that such disclosure is necessary to (a) comply with relevant laws or to respond to subpoenas or warrants served on us; or (b) to protect and defend our rights or property, you, or third parties. You hereby consent to us sharing your Personal Information under the circumstances described herein.
	<br/><br/>
	
	<h3>The Ability of Others to View Your Information</h3>
	Helping you to protect your information is a vital part of our mission. It is up to you to make sure you are comfortable with the information you choose to provide us and the information you choose to publish. You understand that when you use Kapow, certain information you post or provide through Kapow, such as your name, profile, comments, collections and reviews, may be shared with other users and posted on publicly available portions of Kapow, including without limitation, social media applications and other public forums in which you choose to participate. Please keep in mind that if you choose to disclose Personal Information when posting comments or other information or content through Kapow, this information may become publicly available and may be collected and used by others, including people outside the Kapow community. We will not have any obligations with respect to any information that you post to parts of Kapow available to others, and recommend that you use caution when giving out personal information to others through social media networks or otherwise.

	<h3>Third Party Sites and Advertising</h3>

	Kapow offers Facebook users the opportunity to interact with friends and to share on Facebook using Facebook Connect.

If the email addresses do not match, we ask you if you want to link them and you must validate that you control the accounts. If you are already logged into Kapow but not logged into Facebook, when you use the Site's Facebook connection functions, you will be prompted to enter your Facebook credentials or to sign up for Facebook. By proceeding through any of these scenarios, you grant Kapow permission to access your Facebook profile information and to use it in accordance with the Facebook terms of use and this Privacy Statement.  If you are not currently registered as a Kapow user and you use the Site's Facebook connection functions, you will first be asked to enter your Facebook credentials and then be given the option to register and join Kapow. Once you register with Kapow and connect with Facebook, you will be able to automatically post recent Kapow activity back to your Facebook wall. Please refer to the privacy settings in your Facebook account to manage the performance of your Facebook account.

	You may manage the sharing of certain Personal Information with us when you connect with us through Facebook Connect, or any social media platform or application.
