Celebrating the classic look of Scott Summers from the Jim Lee era of the early 1990s, the mutant leader and tactical genius prepares an optic blast for whatever the Danger Room can throw at him.Cyclops wears what many consider to be his coolest costume, a sleek blue bodysuit with bright yellow accessories like trunks, gloves, boots, harness, and a variety of belts.While not always the most physically imposing X-Man, "Slim" here shows that he''s been working out with a powerful physique and tensed muscles.Cyclops leans forward with arms outstretched at his sides in a classic pose that means he''s about to unleash a blast of massive concussive force.The mutant leader has all of the fine attention to detail you''ve come to know and love from the Danger Room Sessions series, especially in the nuances of his costume.Each belt and strap is individually sculpted along with pouches and "X" symbols.Cyclops has an excellent head sculpt that captures the hero''s ferocious intensity as well as his windblown brown hair. Sculpted by Erick Sosa, Cyclops stands 10  inches tall in 16th scale with the other Danger Room Sessions members like Psylocke, Wolverine, and Colossus.Also like them, Scott Summers stands on a unique Danger Room holographic environment; this one features half of a smashed Sentinel head!No Danger Room set or Cyclops collection would be complete without this amazing Fine Art Statue.', '2013-03-07 11:04:42', '2013-03-07 11:04:42'),
